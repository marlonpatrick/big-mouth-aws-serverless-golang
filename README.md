# big-mouth-aws-serverless-golang

# Introduction

This project is based on [Production-Ready Serverless](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/production-ready-serverless) Manning Course authored by [Yan Cui AWS Serverless Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/yan-cui/) with focusing on AWS Lambda Operational Patterns and Best Practices.

## Changes from original course

I made some changes to the original course implementation to challenge myself, and at the same time, learn new technologies.
